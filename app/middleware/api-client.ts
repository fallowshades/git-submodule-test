/**
 * This middleware is used to create an authenticated API client instance.
 *
 * It uses the access token stored in the context to create the client and
 * store it in the context so we can use it in the rest of the app to do
 * authenticated requests to the API.
 *
 * This could easily be done in each loader or action too, but there's a benefit
 * to do it here. Since the API client instance is shared between all the
 * loaders and actions, we can implement caching and other optimizations in the
 * API client itself.
 *
 * This is useful for example to avoid doing the same request multiple times in
 * the same request cycle, useful if multiple loaders may need to read the same
 * data from the API because they run all in parallel.
